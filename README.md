# capstone_2 : The Hit Maker
ML (Machine Learning) Capstone

•	Data set used will be The Spotify Hit Predictor Dataset (1960 - 2019).
•	Dataset contains 41,106 rows with 19 columns of categorical and continuous data.

I sought to build a classification algorithm that could predict a hit song based on the various categorical and continuous features of the song.
I cleaned the data by eliminating what I believed to be useless columns.
Scaled the data before splitting into training and testing sets.
Ran seven different classifiers with varying parameters before picking two for fine tune. Went from fine tuning two algos to hypertuning the best of the fine tuned algos. 
Used Pandas, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, SKLearn, Numpy, and various other Python packages. 

Included is a PowerPoint presentation of my findings.
